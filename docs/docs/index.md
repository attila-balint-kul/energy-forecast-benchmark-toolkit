Energy Forecast Benchmark Toolkit is a Python project that aims to provide common tools to
benchmark forecast models.


## Installation

Use the package manager pip to install foobar.

```bash
pip install enfobench
```

## Usage

Load your own data and create a dataset.

```python
import pandas as pd

from enfobench.dataset import Dataset

# Load your datasets
data = pd.read_csv("../path/to/your/data.csv", parse_dates=['timestamp'], index_col='timestamp')

# Create a target DataFrame that has a pd.DatetimeIndex and a column named 'y'
target = data.loc[:, ['target_column']].rename(columns={'target_column': 'y'})

# Add covariates that can be used as past covariates. This also has to have a pd.DatetimeIndex
past_covariates = data.loc[:, ['covariate_1', 'covariate_2']]

# As sometimes it can be challenging to access historical forecasts to use future covariates, 
# the package also has a helper function to create perfect historical forecasts from the past covariates.
from enfobench.dataset.utils import create_perfect_forecasts_from_covariates

# The example below creates simulated perfect historical forecasts with a horizon of 24 hours and a step of 1 day.
future_covariates = create_perfect_forecasts_from_covariates(
    past_covariates,
    horizon=pd.Timedelta("24 hours"),
    step=pd.Timedelta("1 day"),
)

dataset = Dataset(
    target=data['target_column'],
    past_covariates=past_covariates,
    future_covariates=future_covariates,
)
```

The package integrates with the HuggingFace Dataset ['attila-balint-kul/electricity-demand'](https://huggingface.co/datasets/attila-balint-kul/electricity-demand). 
To use this, just download all the files from the data folder to your computer.

```python
from enfobench.dataset import Dataset, DemandDataset

# Load the dataset from the folder that you downloaded the files to.
ds = DemandDataset("/path/to/the/dataset/folder/that/contains/all/subsets")

# List all meter ids
ds.metadata_subset.list_unique_ids()

# Get dataset for a specific meter id
target, past_covariates, metadata = ds.get_data_by_unique_id("unique_id_of_the_meter")

# Create a dataset
dataset = Dataset(
    target=target,
    past_covariates=past_covariates,
    future_covariates=None,
    metadata=metadata
)
```


You can perform a cross validation on any model locally that adheres to the `enfobench.Model` protocol.

```python
import MyModel
import pandas as pd
from enfobench.evaluation import cross_validate

# Import your model and instantiate it
model = MyModel()

# Run cross validation on your model
cv_results = cross_validate(
    model,
    dataset,
    start_date=pd.Timestamp("2018-01-01"),
    end_date=pd.Timestamp("2018-01-31"),
    horizon=pd.Timedelta("24 hours"),
    step=pd.Timedelta("1 day"),
)
```

You can use the same crossvalidation interface with your model served behind an API. 
To make this simple, both a client and a server are provided.

```python
import pandas as pd
from enfobench.evaluation import cross_validate, ForecastClient

# Import your model and instantiate it
client = ForecastClient(host='localhost', port=3000)

# Run cross validation on your model
cv_results = cross_validate(
    client,
    dataset,
    start_date=pd.Timestamp("2018-01-01"),
    end_date=pd.Timestamp("2018-01-31"),
    horizon=pd.Timedelta("24 hours"),
    step=pd.Timedelta("1 day"),
)
```

The package also collects common metrics used in forecasting.

```python
from enfobench.evaluation import evaluate_metrics

from enfobench.evaluation.metrics import (
    mean_bias_error,
    mean_absolute_error,
    mean_squared_error,
    root_mean_squared_error,
)

# Simply pass in the cross validation results and the metrics you want to evaluate.
metrics = evaluate_metrics(
    cv_results,
    metrics={
        "mean_bias_error": mean_bias_error,
        "mean_absolute_error": mean_absolute_error,
        "mean_squared_error": mean_squared_error,
        "root_mean_squared_error": root_mean_squared_error,
    },
)
```

In order to serve your model behind an API, you can use the built in server factory.

```python
import uvicorn
from enfobench.evaluation.server import server_factory

model = MyModel()

# Create a server that serves your model
server = server_factory(model)
uvicorn.run(server, port=3000)
```

## Benchmarking

The package also provides a benchmarking framework that can be used to benchmark your model against
other models. 

The results of the benchmarking are openly accessible [here](https://wandb.ai/attila-balint-kul/load-forecasting-competition/reports/Enfobench-Dashboard--Vmlldzo2MDM0ODE2#models).
